                at least 2 apis using axios, useEffect and useState but I used tree Apis.
                But it isn't responsive yet because we have to go fast with the program and I don't want to be left behind 
                but I'll work on it after the bootcamp */}
                This project was created using React, a Football API and the Sportmonks API using axios  to call
                the APIs. I learned how to work with React Hooks, such as useEffect and useState and more ...
                It's not Yet responsive because at the moment I am also learning java but once done I will 
                have to work on the css part to make it responsive
